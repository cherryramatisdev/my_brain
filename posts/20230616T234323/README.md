## Introduction

On this article I'll present to you my approach to taking notes and not trusting my brain to remember stuff and why you should do the same!

### Why you shouldn't trust your brain

A lot of developers don't maintain an annotation repository because they trust that any information will become available on their brains and often this create awful situation where you need to find that particular link from a 2010 stack overflow post that solves your exactly problem and you think "Only if I had this on a notebook to consult right now", relatable right?

This lead us to two main factors where we shouldn't trust our brain:

1. Searchability: This is a very important aspect where our brain can't win the machine that is categorizing and providing a search interface to find useful notes for each situation
2. Portability/Storage: This is the most obvious one, if you store correctly (we'll talk about it) your notes it's almost certain that this "second brain" will never disappear and you can easily port to any device with the correct authentication.

## What methodology/mental model to use?

Today I try to maintain the [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) method as close as possible because it's easier to search, maintain and produce useful content out of it.

The zettelkasten method developed by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) sits on some principles:

1. Each note(or zettel) should be small and objetive about one topic or idea
2. Each note should follow a specific naming pattern (usually ISO date like 20230730143000) so it's easy to parse and find later
3. You should use links between the notes, that way you can group all the linked notes in one place to produce a bigger note (article or paper)
