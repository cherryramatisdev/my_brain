OOP is programming paradigm that was originally meant to be called "Message driven development" mostly because object is a very broad view with no specific definition. 

The idea behind OOP is to encapsulate and deal with states in a more secure and controlled way possible. Essentially, we're acknowledging that state exists and we need to own it.

Functional the other way lives under the thinking model that we should minimize state at all costs and try always to have **no state** in what we call "pure functions".

Here is important to understand the "state" is not simply a variable but rather is *anything that lives outside the scope of my current function*
