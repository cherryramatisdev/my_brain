In the previous articles we've seen how to create processes for asynchronous tasks, how to persist state through a long running process and even how to implement a message based architecture for communication with a process, how much more things we can do with processes in elixir for god sake!? Uh hu hu _clears throat_, the last action on the great circle of life is dealing with the death of a process and this is precisely what we'll look at this article; Supervisors is a neat architecture that defines strategies for reviving our processes after they die and with that we can loudly say the elixir phrase "Let it crash".
