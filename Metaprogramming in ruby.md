The ruby programming language is known for two major facts: One is it's core philosophy with object oriented programming where "Everything is a object", the other important one is it's incredible flexibility to define DSLs and "magic" classes. This magic is on purpose and a quite special feature of ruby called **metaprogramming**, at this article we'll see more about the deep nested details of ruby and how to create magic APIs with metaprogramming!
