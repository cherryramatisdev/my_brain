## Functional programming
### Pros
- Controlled scenarios in any context of the codebase
- Easier to test scenarios without relying on heavy mocking
- Simpler to understand pure functions instead of highly mutable functions

### Cons
- Hard to learn for beginners (need to adapt some concepts comparing to OOP/procedural)
- Maybe not the most performant paradigm if you really need high performance and memory usage

## OOP

### Pros
-  ??????????????????????????????????????????????????//
### Cons
